‚Ä¢ Ktor<br />
‚Ä¢ Gson<br />
‚Ä¢ Koin<br />
‚Ä¢ Coroutines<br />

# Securing Api Key üëÆüèª
‚Ä¢ To secure the API key in this project, we used the BuildConfigField approach, which injects the API key during the build process. The key is stored securely in the local.properties file, which is not tracked by version control, and is injected into the app at build time. This avoids hardcoding the key directly into the source code, making it more secure.

Additional Security Options:

‚Ä¢ **Encrypted SharedPreferences:** Securely stores sensitive data, such as API keys, on the device by encrypting it before storing it. However, it can still be accessed if the device is compromised.

‚Ä¢ **NDK (Native Development Kit):** Stores sensitive data in native C++ code, making it more difficult to reverse-engineer. It offers an added layer of security but is not entirely foolproof against skilled attackers.

# Supported Android Version ‚Ñπ
‚Ä¢ Android 9 (Api 28) and above

# Test Coverage üß™

This project includes comprehensive **unit tests** and **UI tests** to ensure the robustness and reliability of the application:

‚Ä¢ **Unit Tests** <br />
Implemented unit tests for almost all features and scenarios of the application.
These tests cover core business logic, data transformations, and edge cases to ensure the app behaves as expected across different use cases.

‚Ä¢ **UI Tests** <br />
The project also includes extensive UI test cases for the Tables Screen using Jetpack Compose Testing.
By covering both unit and UI testing, we aim to provide a reliable user experience and maintain the app's quality over time.
